                            <p>How would you best define your lifestyle and how does this way of life influence your work?</p>
                            <p>My lifestyle is heavily influenced by my work as I am constantly reading scripts, watching movies, hearing pitches, looking at rough cuts, visiting movie sets, participating in script meetings and coming up with great ideas for movies. I also watch a movie every night before I go to bed so I'm not exaggerating to say I eat, sleep and breathe movies.</p>
                            <p>2.What are your long-term ambitions, both personally and professionally?</p>
                            <p>Professionally, I hope to develop a successful media company (RatPac Entertainment) with my partner, James Packer, while continuing to direct and produce movies. Personally, I hope to have a family one day soon.</p>
                            <p>3.Of all the places you have traveled for work, which have impressed you the most? Why?</p>
                            <p>China. Although I've only filmed in Hong Kong, I have had the opportunity to travel all over China. I find the rise of the middle-class fascinating, and I'm extremely fascinated by Asian culture.</p>
                            <p>4.What projects are you currently involved in?</p>
                            <p>As director, I am currently working on developing Beverly Hills Cop 4. As a producer, I am Involved in 'Horrible Bosses 2', Russell Crowe's directorial debut 'The Water Diviner', Warren Beatty's Untitled Howard Hughes Project, the independent film Truth starring Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford, Hank Williams Biopic starring Tom Hiddleston, and Alejandro Inarritu's The Revenant starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. And then probably about another 10 or so more.</p>

                                    <p>About China</p>
                                    <p>1.What are your thoughts about Chinese culture? Do you feel that young Chinese artists are ushering in a new era for Chinese arts and film?</p>
                                    <p>I've always been a fan of Chinese culture as I find it so fascinating. The depth of history in China is so great that it has influenced the work of so many young artists in both the cinematic and art worlds. Chinese Artists in all art forms are exceptional.</p>
                                    <p>2.Which Asian filmmakers do you most admire?</p>
                                    <p>I'm a huge fan of Zhang Yimou whose film Ju Dou is one of my all time favorites starring Gong Li. How can I not mention Ang Lee, a fellow NYU alum? Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai. Chen Kaige the director of Farewell My Concubine. I also admire many Chinese filmmakers in the action genre, such as John Woo, Johnnie To, Andy Lau, Tsui Hark, and of course He Ping. However, I am excited to discover the new generation of Chinese filmmakers.</p>
                                    <p>3.What do you feel are China's contributions to the movie industry as a whole? How might these contributions grow or change in the future?</p>
                                    <p>I truly believe that China's film industry is going to produce some of the world's greatest filmmakers. As the globalization of film continues, Chinese film, which for many years was somewhat of a cult phenomenon globally, in my opinion, will become China's best export.</p>
                                    <p>4.What should Chinese filmmakers learn from the movie industry in Hollywood? Conversely, what might those in Hollywood learn from filmmakers in China?</p>
                                    <p>I think there are a number of things that we can learn from each other. Chinese filmmakers can learn from the way we make movies, and create production values, while we can learn from the way Chinese filmmakers produce such great</p>

                                    <p>films on such low budgets. During filming for Rush Hour, I witnessed first-hand how filmmakers can save time and money very quickly the Chinese way. Jackie Chan taught me that it wasn't necessary to bring a crane to the roof of a building just to see over the edge. He wrapped a rope around his waist &amp; asked the crew to hold him tightly while he put the camera to his eye and leaned over the edge of the building. He saved us a day and a half of trying to bring a crane to the roof of a very tall building while saving us thousands of dollars.</p>
